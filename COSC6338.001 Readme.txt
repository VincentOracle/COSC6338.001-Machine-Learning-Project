To run the program:

1. Install Python 3.x on your computer if not already installed.

2. Download the TrainData.csv and TestData.csv files and save them in the same directory as the program file.

3. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the program file and data files are saved.

4. Install the required Python packages using the following command: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn.

5. Run the program using the following command: python classifier.py.

The program will train the Logistic Regression classifier on the training set, test the classifier on the test set, 
and output the accuracy of the classifier.

Note: Make sure that the program file and data files are saved in the same directory and that the file names match those specified in the program. 
Also, the program assumes that the data files are in CSV format and have the same format as the example files provided. 
If using different data files, make sure that the format is compatible with the program.
